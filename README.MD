# `note`

a new command, (`$ note`) to help you take notes. Gives fast ability to add notes to your
notes file through the `note` command or open up your selected notes file for an interactive edit.

# installation (Linux / Mac OS)

Execute the install script with root privileges. Either change directory `cd`
to the downloaded directory (or local repository): `note_taker`, or use the
path to the installation file (i.e. ./[PATH_TO_FILE]/install.bash).

```
$ sudo ./install.bash
```

- Note: This script creates a copy of the repository in the directory
`/opt/note_taker/`; the update, overwrites that copy. Then a symbolic link
is created in the directory `/usr/local/bin/`, which is generally
designated for user programs not managed by the distribution package manager

- you can specify the command if you don't like `note`

- The editor for interactive and edit options is set to the global editor defined in your
git config file or if unset, it is `vim`. To set your default editor for note command,
use this command:

```
git config --global core.editor "emacs"
```

# Usage

```
$ note [abcefptu] [NS] [<SUBJECT>] [<MESSAGE_LINE_1>] [<MESSAGE_LINE_2>] ...
```

The execution command for the note taker can be specified by user choice during installation or manually.

- usage with no options to add notes

```
$ note "<A_NEAT_SUBJECT_GOES_HERE>" "This one line of a Note" "and another line to document" ...
```

## Options

- Usage with options for management

```
$ note [-abcefptu] [NS]
```

**\-a** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`all` pipes the entire notes file through less for quick analysis

**\-b** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`backup`, creates copy of note taker file with a hash extension as a backup

**\-c** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`clear` clears all notes in the notes file

**\-e** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
interactive `edit` of your notes, no timestamp added

**\-f S** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`find` string matching **S** (regex enabled) using:

```
grep --ignore-case --before-context=3 --after-context=3 --color --extended-regexp "$2"
```

**\-p** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`paste`, adds pbpaste (clipboard) content to note pad

**\-t N** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`tail` output last **N** lines of notes (N is optional, defaults to 10)

**NOTE:** see the install instructions to set your editor of choice for `-e` and `-i` options

**\-u** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`undo` deletes the most recent note in the notes file. Specifically, it deletes the
text-to-last line and continues deleting lines upwards until it enounters another blank
line. This works well with notes made using the program prompt but may produce unexpected
results if the notes file has been interactively edited and no longer follows the default
formatting.
